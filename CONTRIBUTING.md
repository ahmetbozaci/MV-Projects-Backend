If you see some issue or you want to add or improve some feature, please open an issue before working on the project. Please make sure there is no related issue and nobody is doing the same change at the same time.

Contribution to this project is very much like contributing to any other Free/Libre and Open Source project. Just follow these steps:

1. Fork this repo.
2. Clone your fork on your system.
3. Make a new branch from the `develop` branch (This is important here! You need to checkout to the `develop` branch and then make a branch).
4. Make the local development environment ready by running `bundle install`.
5. Commit your changes.
6. Push your commits to your fork.
7. Send Pull Request from your new branch on your fork to this project's **develop branch**.

You are done. I will get notified and then take the next steps accordingly.

If later you need to contribute, you need to first make sure your fork is up to date. You should see a button on your fork for synchronization. After that, you need to use `git pull` on your clone (on you local machine) to get latest commits and then the rest is the same...
